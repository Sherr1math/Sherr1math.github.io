## Introduction
This is an **analysis problem** from *2022~2023 boling class mathematical-analysis-III mid-term examination paper*. This post will show you the problem and its connecting problem from *Mathematical-analysis-III of Nankai University* **Exercise 14(B)-13**.
## Problem from Exercise Paper
***
**Problem**
设 $\alpha\gt0$，讨论级数
