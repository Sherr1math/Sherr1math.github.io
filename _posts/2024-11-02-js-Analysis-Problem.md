## Introduction
This is an **analysis problem** from *2022~2023 boling class mathematical-analysis-III mid-term examination paper*. This post will show you the problem and its connecting problem from *Mathematical-analysis-III of Nankai University* **Exercise 14(B)-13**.
## Problem from Exercise Paper
> 设 $\alpha\gt0$，讨论级数
\[\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\cos\sqrt{n}}{n^{\alpha}}\]的收敛性(若收敛，精确到条件收敛和绝对收敛)
## Problem from Textbook
For the more information about the following problem, you can refer to the book *Mathematical-analysis-III of Nankai University* **Exercise 14(B)-13**.
> 设$\alpha\in(0,1)$，$p>max\left\{\alpha,1-\alpha\right\}$，则
\[\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sin n^{\alpha}}{n^p}\text{收敛}\]
