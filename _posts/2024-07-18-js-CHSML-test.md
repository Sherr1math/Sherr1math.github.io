## Introduction
In the summer of 2024, I got a teaching assistant job to guide high school students in participating in the Chinese High School Mathematics League(**CHSML**).

Here are two sample test questions and my solutions during my tenure as a teaching assistant.

## Test 1
The types of questions in this test are **Algebraic** and **Number Theory** problems.

What's interesting about this **Test** is the last problem, which is a bit of a combinatorial question.
